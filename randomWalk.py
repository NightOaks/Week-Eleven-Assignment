# Basic Structure for a Random Walk simulation
# Dan Neumann
'''

You flip a coin.
If it comes up heads, you take a step forward;
tails means to take a step backward.
Repeat this n times.
Calculate distance from start

Repeat this process a large number of times.
Calculate and print the average for a given value of n
Start with 100 to 1000, step 10
